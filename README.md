# TREKIS-4
 Time-REsolved Kinetics in Irradiated Solids

A hybrid code combining Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulation of the effects of radiation impact on matter. It can model swift-heavy ion, photon, electron or positron impacts.

For all details and instruction, please address the manual (available in English and Russian).
